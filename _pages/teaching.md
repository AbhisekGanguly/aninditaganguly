Research plays a pivotal role in our teaching approach as we believe it is essential for students to develop strong analytical skills, critical thinking abilities, and a deep understanding of the subject matter. I strive to create an engaging and inclusive learning environment that fosters intellectual curiosity, encourages active participation, and promotes collaborative learning. I believe in providing a strong theoretical foundation while incorporating practical applications and real-world examples to enhance the learning experience.


During PhD, I have co-taught two graduate and undergraduate courses with Prof. Kuo Yuan Hwa - Advanced Biomaterials and Nanotechnology. In addition I have also mentored undergraduate students in our research group with their research and coursework.

Currently, I am mentoring 12 graduate students in our research group.
